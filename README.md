## 🏠 Home Prediction Model

This project is focused on building a machine learning model to predict home-related outcomes, such as house prices or rent values, based on various features (e.g., location, size, number of rooms). While the dataset is currently not included in this repository due to privacy or availability reasons, the code is structured and ready for integration with any suitable housing dataset.

### 🔍 Project Goals

- Develop a predictive model using machine learning.
- Understand the relationship between housing features and target variables.
- Provide a modular, reproducible codebase for training and testing.
