## 🔥 Forest Fire Prediction Model

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood or severity of forest fires based on environmental and meteorological factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall. Accurate forest fire predictions can play a critical role in disaster preparedness and resource management.
