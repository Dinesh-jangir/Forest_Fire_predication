# ðŸ”¥ Forest Fire Prediction Model

This project aims to predict the likelihood or severity of forest fires based on environmental and meteorological factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall. Accurate predictions are crucial for disaster preparedness and resource management.

> **Note:** The dataset is not included in this repository. Please connect your own dataset or use publicly available sources (e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository).

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- Develop a machine learning model to predict forest fires.
- Analyze key factors influencing fire occurrence and spread.
- Provide a reusable and modular codebase for experimentation and deployment.
